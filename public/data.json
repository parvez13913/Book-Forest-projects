      "reviews": "Excellent Book!!! I almost didn't get the book because I read the 1 star reviews and they said it was a simplistic redo of the same messages many others had done. Well, I am so happy I went ahead and bought it in spite of the negative reviews. As you can see I'm a 5 star for the book. I heard Hal Elrod on a webinar and was excited to read the book based upon his presentation, there were a lot of 5 star reviews and I decided to get it. After reading the book, I do not understand the negativity of the 1 star reviewers. Condensing important behaviors into actionable action steps is a good thing in my evaluation. Keeping it simple even better. I found it to be a very smooth transition into the new routine.\r\n",

      "reviews": "The book is actually 20 pages long. Or at least that's how it should be. Saturated with verbose and unwanted information. So many repetitions on the accident he had and all. Phew! Solid content when he is not beating about the Bush but sadly I was doing a lot of skimming and strikethroughs instead of underlining and highlighting like he suggested. Dw....its still a good read because the deeper you go, the better. Also if you like autobiographies and other information, this book is for you (which I doubt because you bought the book for its contents)\r\n",

My mom found this book in the library we always go to and got it for me and man never have I been so thankful to destiny for making me find this book. It's not just dry philosophy but deals with real issues and a practical approach to solving them. Hal Elrod knows what it's like to be at your worst and tells you exactly how to get to your best. The man's a genius really. It has changed my life in so many ways I don't know where to start. Although I'm only 16 I feel awesome and content with my life. Pick this book up, it will change your life in astonishing ways\r\n",
